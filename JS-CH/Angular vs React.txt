Angular
Data-Binding has an upper hand bcz it supports both one-way & two-way binding.
Dependency injection is enabled by Angular, which allows different stores to separate life cycles.
It lacks in providing freedom & flexibility compared to react. 
The installation time of Angular is less compared to react bt it has more coding time which causes delays in project deliveries.

React
Data-Binding supports only one-way data binding.
Each component of REACT has its global state, dependency injection is fully on enabled by react.
It provides you flexibility & freedom to choose architecture, libraries & tools.
It takes more time to install bt it very fast in project deliveries & app development.
