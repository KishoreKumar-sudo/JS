// generating a random number b/w 

// We can use this value in the range (0,1) to find the random value between any two numbers using formula:
//Math.random() * (highestNumber - lowestNumber) + lowestNumber
const a = Math.random() * (10 - 1) + 1;
console.log(`Random value between 1 and 10 is ${a}`);

//This will show a random floating-point number greater than 1 and less than 10.
